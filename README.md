These are all the configuration files that I made to make my tools more comfy, feel free to customize it as your own needs. I also wrote the `autoconfig.sh` to perform a quick setup whenever I move to a new development environment or reinstall my OS.

### How to use autoconfig.sh

Display help and all config options:

```
bash autoconfig.sh
```

Config your selected option

```
bash autoconfig.sh [<option>]
```

or config everything with

```
bash autoconfig.sh all
```
