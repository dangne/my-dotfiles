# Hello there!

These are all the personal configuration files that I made to make my tools more comfy. You may find configuration for Vim, Git and Octave in here, feel free to customize it as your own needs. I also wrote an autoconfig script to perform a quick setup whenever I move to a new development environment or reinstall my OS.



### How to use autoconfig.sh

Display help and all config options:

```
bash autoconfig.sh
```

Config your selected option

```
bash autoconfig.sh [<option>]
```

or config everything with

```
bash autoconfig.sh all
```
